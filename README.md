BFC
===

This is a simple BrainFuck compilier, originally written just for fun.
BrainFuck is a interesting language, because it's Turing-complete 
and very simple to understand.

Currently it has following operating modes:

- libc - generates code to be linked together with libc
- linux - generates code based on Linux syscall interface

Also it supports both 32-bit and 64-bit code generation.

Have fun! =)
